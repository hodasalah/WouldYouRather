# Would You Rather ?

This project is a webapp that functions like the popular game "would you rather?". A user signs in, answeres a series of question. The user can view the leaderboard of other players to see their scores, they can create new questions and can view answered polls. The project is a demonstration of how to use redux, react-redux and redux-thunk in single page applications.
